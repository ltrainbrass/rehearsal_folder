# rehearsal-directory

Initially created to prepare rehearsal Google Drive folders using the L Train agenda file.
- Pulls music directory links from configured agenda file
- Copies files in each hyperlinked directoy containing at least one of the configured keywords to an output rehearsal directory. Files are renamed (prefixed with 'a', 'b', etc.) to preserve song order specified in agenda

#### TODO: Documentation, installation instructions, requirements
